The final project will test you on everything we have learned in this course. You will create a Django website. Users of your site will be able to privately create and share notes. All users will have an account and they will be able to signup then login to their account. Once logged in they will be able to write notes in the web app. While creating the note they will have the option to share the note with another user of the web app. The app will contain a page where the user can see the notes that they have created and the notes that have been shared with them.

You may work in groups of no more than two individuals. 

What are the next steps? Please read this document for more details on the assignment. Then read the materials posted on Moodle pertaining to Django and follow the videos provided to you. 

Do not submit to Grader Than. Please make a screen recording demonstrating all of the functionality of your website. The screen recording video must include you working with all of the features outlined in the assignment details document. If the video does not demonstrate that your website can perform a particular feature you will receive a zero for that particular feature. Even if the feature has bugs please still demonstrate its partial functionality. You may upload more than one video. Please upload your video(s) to Moodle.   

Please use your time wisely. Late submissions will not be accepted for this project.
